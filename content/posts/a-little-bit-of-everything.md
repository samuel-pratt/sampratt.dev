If you've found this draft on my github, congrats! But it's less of a coherent article and more just disconnected musings about the upcoming change in my life.

A little bit of everything, all of the time - A reflection on the uncertainty of my immediate future.

---

Today is Wednesday June 23rd, and I have 2 full days left at Ensemble with no confirmed next step. This weekend i'm going to the interior with my girlfriend and two friends and it will most likely be a lovely trip, but the whole time it will be hanging over my head that I will have no immediate purpose when I get back. This honestly kind of terrifies me. I don't think there's been any point in my life where I have had this level of uncertainty about what my life will be like only a week or two from now.

I have a few ideas of what I want to do.

I have a good feeling about a job at Momentum Dash, but I haven't got a concrete offer yet so I don't want to build my expectations too much.

I'm helping a friend with his startup, and I'm hoping this leads to future opportunities within their company should I do a good job.

I know I want to write more. Both for me in these hidden drafts and also publicly. I can write about projects I have going on, things I'm learning, and challenges I've overcome that others might find useful. I can keep these hidden ones going too, until someone finds them and I'm embarrased into deleting them.

I'm also cutting my hair.

This might seem like a small thing to most people, and it is, it's honestly surprising me how nervous and excited I am for it.

Growing up my dad cut my hair, usually very short and simple, and even when I started going to the barber I never changed anything, just stuck with the same style every time.

When I got into high school I tried different styles, none of which stuck. Plus I was fairly limited in choice because it was a private, Catholic, all boys school with a strict dress code, including a rule that hair cannot go past your shirt collar.

When I went to UVic though I just stopped cutting my hair. I'm not sure if this was because I wanted to try it or because I was lazy and didn't want to bus downtown. Throughout the first two years I'd only cut my hair when people started commenting that it was getting too long.

Once I was kicked out of UVic I worked as a line cook at Bard and Banker while doing an even worse job at a different school, Camosun college. I didn't cut my hair once during this time, and I was kind of enjoying it.

My luck changed in October though when I got a job at Ensemble Systems, my first dev job. I entered with fairly long hair and got a positive reception to it, so I kept it. And then the pandemic hit. It's been almost 2 years since I've last cut my hair and it's down to my mid back now, but now also seems like the right time.

I'm leaving my job, society is reopening, and I'm about to enter what I see as the make or break point of the rest of my life. It only seems fitting with all this change that I change something visible too. So today I'm going to go cut my hair, and I can look back in photos that this was the point where it all worked out or all went to shit. Or more realisticaly something somewhere in between those two.

I've been watching Bo Burnham's "Inside" a lot recently, as have many people, and I find myself relating to his dilemma a lot. He wants to finish the special, but doing so would also be ending the work that has provided himself with a sense of purpose for all those months inside. I don't want to work at Ensemble forever, I don't want to grow my hair out forever, but it's still scary to take the leap. I'm terrified of what it will be like to come back next week without that purpose, and even more terrified to realize that it's entirely up to me to create some.
