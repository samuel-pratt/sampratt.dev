I'm a Software Developer from Victoria, BC currently working with Feed It Forward. I like building apps and websites that have localized applications for Vancouver Island and UVic. I mostly work in Go and Javascript, but have also made things in Python, Typescript, and Java.

On this site I share some of the projects I've worked on and write about my experiences along the way.

If you're an employer or just interested, you can find my resume [here](/resume.pdf) (Last updated July 2021)

Outside of programming, I enjoy going camping and working on my car. Currently I'm modifying a 2003 Subaru WRX hatchback, and previously I owned a 2001 Outback.
