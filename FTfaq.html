        <h1>Thanks for using Ferry Times!</h1>
        <h2>Please refer to the FAQ below for any questions you might have</h2>
        <p><strong>Why does Ferry Times look like Ferry Rush?</strong>Because it is! Sort of. When Ferry Rush shut down I contacted the developer who was kind enough to allow me to use their interface for a brand new app.</p>
        <p><strong>How do I select a departure terminal?</strong>To get the menu, touch the current departure terminal name at the top of the screen.</p>
        <p><strong>How do I select a route?</strong>After choosing a departure terminal, swipe right to reveal more routes. Some terminals only have one route.</p>
        <p><strong>Can Ferry Times automatically open to the nearest terminal?</strong>This option is available to all users at the top of the Options screen.</p>
        <p><strong>Can I make reservations?</strong>Ferry Times is not affiliated with BC Ferries and therefore cannot make reservations</p>
        <p><strong>Could the data be wrong?</strong>If your device is connected to a network, Ferry Times is pulling fresh data.</p>
        <p><strong>Can it remember my route?</strong>The Premium upgrade unlocks this feature. Ferry Times will open by default to the closest terminal on your favourite route! This is a super, hands-free feature for commuters. Once configured, simple ask Siri to \"open Ferry Times\" and you're set.</p>
        <p><strong>How do I switch the route direction?</strong>With the Premium upgrade, a new icon appears in the top right of the main screen next to the departure terminal.</p>
        <p><strong>Why isn’t my departure terminal listed?</strong>BC Ferries only tracks capacity information for the six major terminals. Smaller terminals (e.g. Bowen and the Gulf Islands) do not track this information.</p>
        <p><strong>Do you keep track of my location?</strong>No. Your location is not sent to our server, and is not stored in the app.</p>
        <p><strong>How do I refresh the data?</strong>Data is refreshed when you reopen the app. Additionally, Premium users can auto-refresh every five minutes. Classic users can touch the “Updated” panel at the bottom of the departures screen after five minutes to refresh.</p>
        <p><strong>Can I change the colour scheme?</strong>You can change the background to black or white with the Premium upgrade.</p>
        <p><strong>Where can I find vessel information and ferry delays?</strong>This onformation is available with the Premium Upgrade. Tap a departure, and a panel will open with oversize fill, a departure forecast, and the ability to share the fill status with a friend.</p>
        <p><strong>What is the duration of the ferry crossing?</strong>Ferry duration is available for most ferries, and is located in the vessel information panel. (see above question)</p>
        <p><strong>How do I load the driving panel?</strong>With the Premium upgrade, an icon of a car will appear on the main screen. Touch the car, and a panel will appear with estimated driving time and the ability to open directions in Maps.</p>
        <p><strong>How often does the driving panel refresh?</strong>Distance and ETA are updated every two minutes when the driving panel is visible. To get a real-time map, press the arrow icon on the right of the panel to load the route in Maps.</p>
        <p><strong>Is there an Apple CarPlay version?</strong>Unfortunately, no. CarPlay apps are limited to navigation and audio apps.</p>
        <p><strong>Is there an iPad version?</strong>Yes, Ferry Times is a universal app. The iPad interface is similar to the iPhone interface, and the guts of the app are the same. You can download both the iPad version at no extra cost.</p>
        <p><strong>Why does the Premium upgrade cost money?</strong>The Premium upgrade helps to cover some of the costs associated with running and maintaining an app. The free basic app is just fine for casual users, and the Premium upgrade is designed for frequent users. It’s cheap, it's a one-time deal, and it’s worth it!</p>
        <p><strong>I previously purchased the Premium upgrade, but I had to reinstall the app. What do I do?</strong>Click on the Restore Purchases button in the Premium section of the Options screen.</p>
        <p><strong>I previously purchased the Premium upgrade, and then bought a new iPhone. It seems like Premium is activated, but some of the options are grayed out. What do I do?</strong>Please delete the app and download it again from the app store. Then follow the instructions above to restore your Premium Purchase.</p>
